## atlassian-shell
A malicious plugin to execute code on Atlassian applications; by default this only executes `whoami`, so people don't just throw up cmd shell's everywhere.

## compile:
```
javac -cp apache-tomcat/lib/servlet-api.jar com/cdl/shell/Cdl.java
zip -r rce.jar atlassian-plugin.xml ./com
```

After installing, it will be available at: `/plugins/servlet/cdl`


## Note:
It seems like Atlassian doesn't support javac v1.11, so please use a newer version. This has been tested with javac v1.8
