## atlassian-shell
A malicious plugin to execute code on Atlassian applications; by default this only executes `whoami`, so people don't just throw up cmd shell's everywhere.

## compile:
```
javac -cp apache-tomcat/lib/servlet-api.jar com/cdl/shell/Cdl.java
zip -r rce.jar atlassian-plugin.xml ./com
```

After installing, it will be available at: `/plugins/servlet/cdl`


## Note:
You'll need the the [Java SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project/).

This was built / tested with javac v1.8
